If we have our own website so we can copy the web URL and give a stream name and then tagging with analytics.
Copy the measurement ID – click on analytics – click on tag then create a account with name and URL – we will get head and body code to tag – copy and past in code with head and body at the end.
Then go to tags where  we can check the URL tagged – copy the measurement ID and paste in URL tagged
